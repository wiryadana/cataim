# Preface {.unnumbered}

In the middle of 2023, I was so fortunate that I passed the admission for Internal Medicine residency program. I believe my knowledge has been barely enough just to start the program. To compensate my lack in memorizing and attention to detail, I build this books. I published it online but not intended to disseminate widely, at least not yet. It is only to help me doing my work.

By the way, this is a Quarto book. Quarto is amazing innovation from Rstudio.org that makes it possible for a lay person creating online books like this one. To learn more about Quarto books visit <https://quarto.org/docs/books>.
